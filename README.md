# Devdle - Software Developer Wordle

Devdle is a Wordle-inspired web application built to challenge your knowledge of 
software! It encompasses 50+ Computer Science and Web Development concepts, 
including descriptions and images of the terms at hand. The rules are the same as 
if you were playing the original Wordle: 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word. Feedback 
will be given in the form of colored-marked tiles that indicate the correctness of 
each guess. Guess the word in under 6 tries to win the game!
